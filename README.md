# Game-Theory-Agent
I created a software agent which can independently participate in a contest with, and against, other agents.

In short the problem involves an assessment of when it is better to cooperate with, or to cheat, others based on previous experiences and interactions (the problem stems from Prisoner's Dilemma in Game Theory).

This assignment demonstrated the ability to use functional and object-oriented programming.

Please read the MS Word file for the full description of this assignment and the pdf file for my finalized agent (with explanation of my strategy).
